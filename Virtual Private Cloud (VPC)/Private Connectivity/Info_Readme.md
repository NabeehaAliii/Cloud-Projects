Hereâ€™s a stack structure for your architecture where the **end-user** connects via a public network to your **Nginx proxy server** in the public subnet, which forwards requests to the **application server** in the private subnet:

### 1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** 
   - The entire architecture is set up within a VPC. The VPC includes both public and private subnets.

### 2. **Subnets**
   - **Public Subnet**: Contains the Nginx proxy server, which has an internet-facing IP address. The Nginx proxy receives incoming requests from end users and forwards them to the application server.
   - **Private Subnet**: Contains the application servers and databases, which are not directly accessible from the internet. Only the proxy server (Nginx) and internal resources can reach them.

### 3. **Nginx Proxy Server (Public Subnet)**
   - **Purpose**: Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from the end user and forwards them to the appropriate application server in the private subnet.
   - **Details**: 
     - Nginx has a **public IP address**.
     - It acts as a **reverse proxy** and is responsible for load balancing (if needed), caching, and forwarding requests.
     - Configured to route traffic to the correct application server based on request patterns.
   
### 4. **Application Servers (Private Subnet)**
   - **Purpose**: Serve the application logic and process requests forwarded from Nginx.
   - **Details**: 
     - The application servers are located in the private subnet.
     - They do not have public IPs and can only communicate internally with Nginx or via a bastion host.
     - Application servers respond to Nginx after processing the request.

### 5. **Database Server (Private Subnet)**
   - **Purpose**: Store the application data.
   - **Details**: 
     - Located in the private subnet alongside the application servers.
     - Access is limited to application servers and internal resources (no public access).
     - Interacts with the application server to fetch and store data.

### 6. **Security Groups**
   - **Public Subnet Security Group**: Allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet to reach the Nginx server.
   - **Private Subnet Security Group**: Allows only internal traffic between Nginx (public subnet) and the application servers. Blocks any external traffic.
   
### 7. **Internet Gateway**
   - **Purpose**: Provides internet access to the resources in the public subnet (Nginx server).
   - **Details**: 
     - Allows the Nginx server to connect to the internet.
     - The Internet Gateway is associated with the public subnet's route table.

### 8. **Route Tables**
   - **Public Subnet Route Table**: Configured to route incoming traffic to the Nginx proxy server through the **Internet Gateway**.
   - **Private Subnet Route Table**: Does not allow direct internet access. Only allows traffic between internal services, i.e., between Nginx and the application/database servers.

### 9. **Optional: NAT Gateway** (For Outbound Traffic from Private Subnet)
   - If your application server or database needs to access the internet (e.g., for updates or APIs), you can use a **NAT Gateway** in the public subnet. It allows private subnet resources to initiate outbound connections to the internet, without exposing them to inbound traffic from the internet.

```

### Benefits of this Architecture:
- **Security**: Application servers and databases are hidden in the private subnet, inaccessible to the public internet.
- **Scalability**: Load balancing and caching can be managed by the Nginx proxy.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Application logic and data are isolated from the proxy handling the web requests.

### FAQ Section (Readme.md for VPC-based architecture):

**Q: What is the benefit of using a public and private subnet setup?**
A: By keeping your application servers and databases in a private subnet, you enhance security by preventing direct public access. Only the Nginx proxy, located in the public subnet, interacts with the public internet, while sensitive data and backend logic remain secure.

**Q: How does Nginx work in this setup?**
A: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding HTTP/HTTPS requests from end users to the backend application servers in the private subnet. Nginx handles the public-facing side of your application.

**Q: What is the role of an Internet Gateway?**
A: An Internet Gateway provides internet access to resources in the public subnet, such as the Nginx proxy server, so they can receive requests from the internet.

**Q: Do I need a NAT Gateway?**
A: A NAT Gateway is needed if resources in the private subnet (such as application servers) need to make outbound connections to the internet (e.g., to fetch updates or make API calls).

**Q: Does creating a VPC and subnets incur charges?**
A: Creating a VPC and subnets generally does not incur charges by itself. However, using services within your VPC, such as NAT Gateways, Internet Gateways, and public IP addresses, may incur additional costs outside the Free Tier.
