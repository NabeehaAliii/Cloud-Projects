# VPC Routing with Longest Prefix Match: A Scenario Explanation

## Scenario Overview
You have three VPCs, V1, V2, and V3:

1. **V1** and **V3** are in the **same region**.
2. **V2** is in a **different region** from V1 and V3.
3. **V1** and **V2** share the **same CIDR block (e.g., 172.16.15.0/24)**, leading to the potential for a conflict when routing.

Connections:

- **V1** and **V3** are peered.
- **V3** and **V2** are peered.
- **V1** and **V2** cannot be directly peered due to the overlapping CIDR blocks.

The key question: When V3 sends a ping to **172.16.15.3**, which exists in both V1 and V2, which VPC's instance will receive the ping?

### **Hint:** Longest Prefix Match

## VPC Peering and Routing
VPC Peering allows you to route traffic between two VPCs using private IP addresses, but requires that the VPCs have **non-overlapping CIDR blocks**. In this scenario, the overlap between **V1** and **V2** prevents direct peering.

However, **V3** is able to peer with both **V1** and **V2**, allowing it to access resources in both VPCs, **but not directly between V1 and V2**.

---

## Routing and Longest Prefix Match

When **V3** sends a packet to an IP (like 172.16.15.3), AWS evaluates the **route tables** in V3 to determine which route the traffic should follow. AWS uses the **Longest Prefix Match (LPM)** algorithm to make this decision.

### **Longest Prefix Match Explained**
- AWS chooses the route with the **most specific (longest) subnet mask** that matches the destination IP address.
- For example, a route to **172.16.15.0/24** would take precedence over a broader route to **172.16.0.0/16**, because `/24` is more specific than `/16`.

### **Which IP will be pinged?**

1. If the **route table** of V3 has a more specific route to **V1** (e.g., **172.16.15.0/24** via V1), then traffic will be routed to **V1**.
2. If the **route to V2** is less specific, it will not be chosen. AWS will prioritize the **most specific match** in terms of subnet mask.

In this scenario, the instance in **V1** will respond to the ping because of the **Longest Prefix Match** rule, provided that the route table is configured to prefer **V1** for that specific range.

## Example Route Table Configuration

To make sure **V3** routes traffic to the right VPC, you need to configure its **route table** correctly:

### VPC V3's Route Table:

| Destination       | Target       | Description                    |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 172.16.15.0/24    | peering-conn-to-V1 | Routes to V1 (more specific)   |
| 172.16.0.0/16     | peering-conn-to-V2 | Routes to V2 (less specific)   |
| 0.0.0.0/0         | Internet Gateway | Routes to the internet        |

In this case, **172.16.15.0/24** in **V1** will have priority over **172.16.0.0/16** in **V2**, meaning that the ping will reach **V1**.

---

## AWS Routing and CIDR Block Overlaps

VPC Peering **does not support overlapping CIDR blocks**. When two VPCs have the same IP range, AWS cannot establish a peering connection between them because it cannot uniquely route traffic. This is why **V1 and V2** cannot be peered.

In this scenario, **V3** acts as a middleman that can route traffic between **V1** and **V2**, but only because it is peered with both and uses **non-overlapping CIDR blocks** for its own IP range.

---

## Summary

In this scenario, the **Longest Prefix Match** principle ensures that traffic will be routed to the **most specific route** in V3’s route table. As a result, if V1 and V2 have overlapping CIDR blocks, the instance in **V1** will respond to the ping because the route to **V1** is more specific in the routing configuration.

### Key Points:
- **VPC Peering** requires **non-overlapping CIDR blocks**.
- **Longest Prefix Match** ensures that the most specific route is prioritized.
- V3 acts as an intermediary for routing between **V1** and **V2**.
