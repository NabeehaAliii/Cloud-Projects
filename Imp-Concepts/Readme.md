To set up a **301 redirect** from `www.yourdomain.com` to `yourdomain.com` (or vice versa) for SEO, follow these steps based on your hosting platform. A 301 redirect is essential for ensuring search engines treat both URLs as a single site, preserving SEO benefits and preventing duplicate content issues.

### 1. **If You’re Using Amazon S3 (For Static Website Hosting)**

If you're hosting a static website on Amazon S3 (which seems to be the case with your domain), you can set up a 301 redirect at the bucket level.

#### Steps:

1. **Create Two S3 Buckets**:
   - One bucket named `practiceaws.click`
   - Another bucket named `www.practiceaws.click`
   
   Ensure that both buckets have the same region.

2. **Configure the `www.practiceaws.click` Bucket for Redirection**:
   - Open the `www.practiceaws.click` bucket.
   - Go to the **Properties** tab.
   - Scroll down to **Static website hosting** and select it.
   - Choose **Redirect requests** and enter `practiceaws.click` in the **Target bucket or domain** field.
   - Leave the **Protocol** field blank or set it to `https`.

3. **Configure the Main Bucket (`practiceaws.click`) to Host the Website**:
   - Open the `practiceaws.click` bucket.
   - Go to **Properties**, and under **Static website hosting**, set it to **Enable** and point it to your website's root object (e.g., `index.html`).

4. **Update DNS (Route 53)**:
   - Go to **Amazon Route 53** or whichever DNS provider you're using.
   - Set up an **A record** and **CNAME**:
     - **A record** for `practiceaws.click` to point to your S3 bucket.
     - **CNAME record** for `www.practiceaws.click` to point to the `practiceaws.click` bucket.

Now, when someone enters `www.practiceaws.click`, they'll be redirected to `practiceaws.click` with a 301 status code.

### 2. **If You’re Using an Apache Web Server**

In case you're hosting on an Apache server (for non-S3 hosting):

1. **Open the `.htaccess` file** in your web root folder (if not present, create one).
   
2. **Add the following lines** to redirect `www` to non-www:
   ```bash
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
   ```
   This rule checks if the `www` is present in the URL and then redirects to the non-www version of the site using a 301 redirect.

3. **Save** and restart your Apache server.

### 3. **If You’re Using NGINX Web Server**

1. Open your NGINX configuration file.
   
2. **Add the following lines** to redirect `www` to non-www:
   ```bash
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name www.practiceaws.click;
       return 301 $scheme://practiceaws.click$request_uri;
   }
   ```

3. Save and restart NGINX using:
   ```bash
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

### 4. **If You’re Using Cloudflare (CDN)**

1. Log into your **Cloudflare** account and select your domain.

2. Go to the **Rules** section and choose **Page Rules**.

3. Set up a redirect like this:
   - URL pattern: `www.practiceaws.click/*`
   - Redirect to: `https://practiceaws.click/$1` (use `$1` to capture any paths and ensure the entire URL is redirected).
   - Status code: **301 (Permanent Redirect)**.

4. Save the rule, and Cloudflare will handle the 301 redirects.

### 5. **For Route 53 (with CloudFront)**

If you are using **Amazon Route 53 with CloudFront**:

1. **Configure CloudFront** with your custom domain:
   - Set up a CloudFront distribution for both `practiceaws.click` and `www.practiceaws.click`.

2. **Set Redirect Behavior**:
   - In the CloudFront distribution settings, configure a behavior to redirect `www` traffic to the non-www domain using the 301 status code.

3. **Set Route 53 DNS**:
   - In **Amazon Route 53**, configure **A** and **CNAME** records for both `www.practiceaws.click` and `practiceaws.click` pointing to your CloudFront distributions.

### Testing the Redirect:
- After you’ve set up the 301 redirect, test it using tools like [Redirect Checker](https://www.redirect-checker.org/) to ensure the redirect is working with a 301 status.
- You can also manually test by visiting `www.practiceaws.click` and ensuring it redirects to `practiceaws.click`.

### Why Use a 301 Redirect?

- **Preserves SEO**: A 301 redirect passes nearly all the SEO equity from the old URL to the new one, helping preserve rankings.
- **Consistency**: Ensures users always land on the preferred version of your site (`non-www` or `www`).
- **Avoids Duplication**: Prevents search engines from treating `www` and `non-www` as duplicate sites, which can dilute rankings.

### Final Steps:
Once the 301 redirect is live, search engines will start prioritizing your chosen version (likely `practiceaws.click`), and any traffic to `www.practiceaws.click` will automatically land on the correct site, preserving both user experience and SEO.
